    <!--  //What is a javascript Library => When using a jsLibrary, your Code is in charge i.e Jquery, Bootstrap, foundation ....
            //What is  a javascript Framework => When using a framework, the framework itself is in charge of your code. i.e Reactjs, Angularjs, Vuejs, Ember, Riot ....
            //What is React => React is a Component based js framework that can respond/react to users events
            //Component => These are the building block of most modern javascript frameworks which comprises of js modules(files)
            //State => These are the "active" parts of a component, that renders appropriate "views" based on the users events or changes in state
            //Props => these are properties that are passed into the components at the point of instantiation
            //VirtualDOM => This is an emulation the DOM, one function  the VirtualDOM is for Optimization of th application.
            
            //Process of VirtualDOM
            //Diffs => Checks to see the components or the aspects of the app that has changed
            //Reconcilation => Implements the change.

            //Webpack => this is a javascript bundler, it's main function is to compress an a/pplication to be able to run on a web browser 
            //Bable => This is another js framework, that helps convert or transpile es6 to es5
            //npm => Node-Packet-Manager => used for installing, updating, upgrading, and removing a node module in a consistent manner

            //create-react-app: this is a React boilerplate module, that helps us scaffold out a new react project
            


            //PROCEDURES FOR CREATING A REACT APP
            //1-Create a div in your page body, to drop the react component
            //2-Create the React App
                  //-initialize your state(if any)
                  //-Create a function/event that will change your the state
                  //-Define the appropriate html view for the new state using the render() and JSX
            //3-Dump the App into the div.


            //Types of Components
                ==> Functional Component => don't require state, mostly used for rendering a markup
                ==> Class Component => Usually requires a state, used for managing the logic of the app
